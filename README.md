# EmployeeTracker

## Description

  The Employee Tracker app will allow the user to input employee information into a database. The app allows the user to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees within their business. This is to assist with managing the organisation and structure of their business. Existing information can also be edited, whilst new employees can still be added and sorted by department.
